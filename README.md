# GolangSlackBot
This project is a slackbot written in Go to calculate the elevy you pay when sending money.

To start the bot:
1. type @<name of the slack app> my amount is <enter the amount you are sending here>. In my case the prompt is: @E-levy calculator my amount is 4000.
2. The bot then responds with the elevy you have to pay.
